Garbage classification has become a crucial concern in today's world, and the use of advanced technologies like machine learning can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of this process. This project focuses on garbage classification using the Xception model, a powerful deep learning architecture designed for image classification tasks.

In the Kaggle website, other algorithms or model are used for training with this dataset. This project tries to use Xception in CNN, and it is also added some hidden layers for the modification. The evaluation is to utilize the unseen data to evaluate the model. The result reaches a high accuracy of predicting the garbage types.
